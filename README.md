The steps and methods used in this project demonstrate proficiency in data cleaning, transformation, and visualization. Below is a detailed explanation of the process:

### Data Preparation
* Standardized Data:

* Ensured consistency in data format (e.g., proper case for text, consistent date formats).
* Removed any duplicates to maintain data accuracy.
* Handled Missing Values:

* Used "Find and Replace" for null values, filling them with meaningful substitutes like averages, medians, or "Not Applicable."
Created Age Brackets:

* Grouped customers into three categories:
Adolescent: Young customers below a certain age threshold.
Middle Age: Customers in their mid-earning years.
Old Age: Senior customers nearing retirement or beyond.
