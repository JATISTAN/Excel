## **Bike Sales Dashboard - Project Overview**  
The **Bike Sales Dashboard** demonstrates expertise in Excel through advanced data cleaning, transformation, and visualization techniques. It provides actionable insights into sales trends, customer demographics, and purchasing behavior.

---

### **Data Preparation**
The dataset was thoroughly cleaned and prepared for analysis using the following steps:  

1. **Standardized Data:**  
   - Applied consistent formatting (e.g., proper case for text, standardized date formats).  
   - Removed duplicates to ensure data accuracy and reliability.  

2. **Handled Missing Values:**  
   - Used "Find and Replace" to address null values.  
   - Filled missing values with meaningful substitutes like averages, medians, or "Not Applicable."  

3. **Created Age Brackets:**  
   - Grouped customers into three meaningful categories:
     - **Adolescent:** Young customers below a defined age threshold.  
     - **Middle Age:** Customers in their mid-earning years.  
     - **Old Age:** Senior customers nearing retirement or beyond.

### **Data Analysis**
Key insights were derived using **pivot tables**, summarized as follows:

1. **Average Income Per Purchase:**  
   - Grouped by gender and purchasing behavior ("Yes/No").  
   - Helped identify income patterns based on gender and buying decisions.

## **Coffee Sales Dashboard - Project Overview**  
The **Coffee Sales Dashboard** showcases advanced Excel techniques such as data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and dashboard creation. It provides actionable insights into customer demographics, product performance, sales trends, and profitability.

---

### **Raw Data**  
The project begins with three datasets:

1. **Customer Data**  
   - Contains details such as `Customer ID`, `Name`, `Email`, `Country`, and `Loyalty Card`.  
    **Overview:**  
   ![](Images/customer0.png)    

2. **Order Data**  
   - Includes information like `Order ID`, `Customer ID`, `Product ID`, `Order Date`, `Quantity`, and `Sales`.  
     **Overview:**  
   ![](Images/order0.png)    

3. **Product Data**  
   - Provides details such as `Product ID`, `Coffee Type`, `Roast Type`, `Size`, `Unit Price`, and `Profit`.  
     **Overview:**  
   ![](Images/products0.png)

---

## **Data Cleaning and Preparation - Step-by-Step**  
The following steps were undertaken to clean and prepare the data for analysis:

### **1. Populating Missing Data Using XLOOKUP**
- Used `XLOOKUP` to fetch customer details (Name, Email, and Country) and product information (Coffee Type, Roast Type, Size, and Unit Price).
- Example for populating Email:  
  `=IF(XLOOKUP(C2,customers!$A$1:$A$1001,customers!$C$1:$C$1001,,0)=0,"",XLOOKUP(C2,customers!$A$1:$A$1001,customers!$C$1:$C$1001,,0))`
- Used `INDEX MATCH` for dynamic population of product data:  
  `=INDEX(products!$A$1:$G$49,MATCH(orders!$D2,products!$A$1:$A$49,0),MATCH(orders!I$1,products!$A$1:$G$1,0))`

### **2. Adding Sales Column**
- Calculated `Sales` as:  
  `=Unit Price * Quantity`

### **3. Enhancing Coffee and Roast Type Names**
- Used `IF` statements to give full names:  
  - Coffee Type:  
    `=IF(I2="Rob","Robusta",IF(I2="Exc","Excelsa",IF(I2="Ara","Arabica",IF(I2="Lib","Liberica",""))))`  
  - Roast Type:  
    `=IF(J2="M","Medium",IF(J2="L","Light",IF(J2="D","Dark","")))`

### **4. Formatting and Cleaning**
- **Date Formatting:** Changed to `dd/mmm/yyyy` for consistency.  
- **Number Formatting:**  
  - `Size`: Converted `1` to `1kg`.  
  - `Unit Price` and `Sales`: Set to USD format.  
- Removed duplicate values.  

### **5. Adding Loyalty Card**
- Auto-populated Loyalty Card column using:  
  `=XLOOKUP([@[Customer ID]],customers!$A$1:$A$1001,customers!$I$1:$I$1001,,0)`

### **6. Converting Range to Table**
- Converted cleaned data into a structured table for easier updates and analysis.
